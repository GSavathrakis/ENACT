# ENACT
This is the official implementation of the paper ENACT: Entropy-based Clustering of Attention Input for Improving the Computational Performance of Object Detection Transformers\
It is a plug-in module, used for clustering the input of Detection Transformers, based on their entropy which is learnable. In its current state
